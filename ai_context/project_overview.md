Project Overview: AI Agent Team for End User Compute (EUC) Assessment

Date: March 26, 2025

1. Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a collaborative team of specialized Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents designed to simulate and execute the process of assessing End User Compute (EUC) subjects, features, or technologies. Currently, performing these assessments thoroughly requires significant time and coordinated effort from multiple subject matter experts (SMEs) across various domains like architecture, security, support, and user experience. This project will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) orchestrated via the LangGraph framework and structured using Pydantic (based on the foundational code from the coleam00/Archon repository) to create a multi-agent system. This system will ingest an assessment request, gather context, perform research, design solutions, analyze implications (security, cost, licensing, support, user impact), and deliver a consolidated, structured report reflecting diverse expert perspectives. The primary benefits sought are increased speed, consistency, and comprehensiveness in the initial assessment phase, freeing up human experts for higher-level analysis and decision-making.

2. Introduction & Problem Statement (Why?)

Assessing new EUC technologies, features, or proposed changes is critical for maintaining a modern, secure, and productive digital workplace. However, the current process often faces challenges:

Time-Consuming: Gathering information and perspectives from busy SMEs in architecture, engineering, security, licensing, support, and user advocacy can be slow.
Inconsistent: The depth and focus of assessments can vary depending on the individuals involved and their available time. Key areas might be inadvertently overlooked.
Resource Intensive: Requires significant coordinated effort from valuable, high-skilled personnel for each assessment, even for initial feasibility studies.
Siloed Information: Integrating diverse viewpoints (e.g., technical feasibility vs. supportability vs. user experience vs. cost) into a single coherent picture can be difficult.
Knowledge Bottlenecks: Reliance on specific individuals can create bottlenecks and risks if they are unavailable.
Addressing these challenges requires a more streamlined, consistent, and efficient approach to the initial stages of EUC assessment.

3. Project Goal & Objectives (What?)

Goal: To create a functional AI Agent Team that automates the initial assessment of EUC topics, providing a rapid, consistent, and comprehensive analysis incorporating key specialist perspectives.

Objectives:

Develop and implement a multi-agent system using the Archon framework (LangGraph, Pydantic) and LLMs.
Define and build approximately 10 distinct AI agent roles mirroring essential EUC functions: Lead Orchestrator, Context & Requirements, Research & Feasibility, Solution Architect, Security Analyst, Licensing Specialist, Implementation Engineer, Support & Operations, User Experience & Enablement, and Cost & Value Analyst.
Establish a robust workflow within LangGraph allowing agents to collaborate, pass information via a shared state, and execute tasks in a logical sequence managed by the Orchestrator.
Enable the system to ingest a user request for an EUC assessment and interact to gather necessary organizational context.
Ensure the system utilizes appropriate tools (e.g., web search, document analysis) as defined for each agent role via the Model Context Protocol concept.
Configure the system to generate a structured, consolidated report summarizing the findings, analyses, and recommendations from all relevant agents.
Demonstrate a significant improvement in the speed and consistency of producing initial EUC assessments compared to purely manual methods.
4. Proposed Solution (How?)

The solution involves constructing a digital "EUC Assessment Unit" composed of specialized AI agents built upon the coleam00/Archon repository's foundation:

Core Concept: A team of AI agents, each specializing in a specific domain relevant to EUC, collaborates to analyze a request.
Agent Roles: The team includes agents dedicated to:
Orchestration: Managing the overall workflow and agent coordination.
Context: Gathering user-specific requirements and organizational details.
Research: Finding relevant external information and solutions.
Architecture: Designing the high-level technical solution.
Security: Analyzing risks and compliance.
Licensing: Assessing licensing models, costs, and compliance.
Implementation: Planning the build, deployment, and testing.
Support: Defining operational and support needs.
User Enablement: Focusing on user documentation, training, and usability.
Cost/Value: Analyzing TCO and potential ROI.
Workflow: A request triggers the Context agent, followed by Research. The Orchestrator then routes information to the Architect. The proposed architecture undergoes parallel analysis by Security, Licensing, and (initially) Cost agents. Based on this, the Orchestrator tasks Implementation, Support, User Enablement, and final Cost agents for detailed planning. Finally, the Orchestrator synthesizes all outputs into the final report.
Technology Stack:
Framework: coleam00/Archon repository clone.
Orchestration: LangGraph for managing agent state and workflow (nodes, edges, conditional routing).
Data Structure: Pydantic for defining the shared state object and agent input/output schemas.
Intelligence: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated via LangChain.
Tools: LangChain tool integrations for web search, document access, calculations, etc., as required by each agent.
5. Expected Benefits (Why - Reinforce)

Accelerated Assessments: Drastically reduce the time needed for initial research, analysis, and report drafting.
Enhanced Consistency: Standardize the assessment process and output format, ensuring key areas are always considered.
Improved Comprehensiveness: Systematically incorporate perspectives from all critical domains (technical, security, cost, support, user).
Optimized Resource Allocation: Allow human SMEs to focus their time on reviewing AI-generated assessments, validating findings, and handling complex strategic decisions, rather than routine information gathering.
Knowledge Codification: The structured nature of the agents' prompts and the workflow helps to codify best practices in EUC assessment.
Scalability: Easier handling of multiple concurrent assessment requests.
6. Scope

In Scope:
Development and implementation of the ~10 defined AI agents within the LangGraph framework.
Definition and implementation of the assessment workflow, including state management using Pydantic.
Integration of basic tools (e.g., web search).
Generation of a consolidated, text-based assessment report.
Basic user interaction for context gathering.
Out of Scope (Initial Version):
Deep, real-time integration with proprietary internal databases or systems (unless via simple, pre-existing APIs).
Fully autonomous decision-making or implementation. Human oversight remains crucial.
Development of a sophisticated graphical user interface (GUI) or dashboard.
Complex simulations or performance testing environments.
7. High-Level Project Plan / Phases

Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup: Configure the Archon/LangGraph environment, define the Pydantic state model, implement the Lead Orchestrator logic and basic graph structure, implement and test Context & Requirements and Research agents.
Phase 2: Specialist Agent Development: Implement the remaining specialist agents (Architect, Security, Licensing, Cost, Implementer, Support, User Enablement), including their specific prompts and necessary tool integrations.
Phase 3: Workflow Integration & Testing: Define all graph edges, implement conditional routing logic for the Orchestrator, conduct end-to-end tests using sample EUC assessment topics, refine agent interactions and state updates.
Phase 4: Refinement, Documentation & Pilot: Improve agent prompts based on test results, enhance error handling, document the system architecture and usage, conduct pilot assessments with stakeholder review.
8. Success Criteria

The AI agent team successfully processes an EUC assessment request from initiation to report generation for defined test scenarios.
The final report is coherent, structured, and demonstrably includes synthesized information corresponding to the relevant agent roles.
The system correctly utilizes context provided by the user.
Key assessment domains (technical feasibility, security, licensing, cost, supportability, user impact) are addressed in the output.
Initial feedback suggests the output provides value as a comprehensive first-pass assessment.
